# US-Vehicle-Accidents-DWH-project

## Project work flow and Summary
#### The basic work flow of the processes of creating the data marts is as follows:
* 1. Identifying data sources (input files)
* 2. Define the ER diagram.
* 3. Draw attribute tree diagram until we get the necessary data for the analysis.
* 4. Conceptual modeling and design (DFM) based on the ER
* 5. Logical modeling and design (star schema) based on the DFM
* 6. Data staging and populating to the reconciled database (ETL process)
* 7. Data visualization and formulating analysis with a help of Tableau
* Data source: One CSV file as input file (data source)
* US Accidents (A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020))
